  abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals stand out due to features such as readily accessible, high reliability and confidentiality, the ease of use etc. among bio-signals. The feasibility studies carried out on the PPG signals demonstrated that PPG signals contained important features for human recognition and were the availability of biometric identification systems. In this study, twenty new features were extracted from PPG signal as a preliminary study intended to biometric recognition. PPG signals with 10 seconds were recorded from five healthy people using SDPPG (second derivative PPG) data acquisition card. To remove the noise from received raw PPG signals, a FIR low pass filtering with 200 points and 10 Hz cut-off frequency was designed. These twenty new features were obtained from filtered PPG signal and its second derivative. PPG signal with 10 seconds contains eight periods and twenty characteristic features in each person must not change within an individual over a period. This feature symbolizes the consistency in the identification of a person. To test the performance of biometric recognition system, the k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) classifier was used and achieved 95 of recognition success rate using 10-fold cross validation with twenty new features. The obtained results showed that the developed biometric recognition system based on PPG signal were very promising.}

  abstract = {Besides revealing useful information, like gender, age, existing impairments, the gait of every person is acknowledged to be so distinctive to allow the personal identification and it is regarded as a valid biometric authentication, similarly to fingerprinting and face recognition. Although the first analyses on the gait were conducted in laboratories with dedicated equipment, portable sensors have been exploited as they become available thanks to the technology miniaturization. Aiming at an even more unobtrusive analysis, recent proposals rely on the data acquired from the 3-axis accelerometer embedded in most of the smartphones commercially available on the market. Nevertheless the analysis must be tailored to the lower-grade accelerometer and the limited computational capability of the smartphone. This paper identifies the guidelines that the state-of-the-art research proposes for the gait recognition through a smartphone and discusses the procedures that are found as more appropriate.},

  abstract = {Gait- A particular way or manner of moving on foot. Gait recognition is the process of identifying an individual by the manor in which they walk. This is a marker less unobtrusive biometric, which offers the possibility to identify people at a distance, without any interaction or co-operation from the subject, this is the property which makes it so attractive as a method of identification. This project aims to develop a system capable of semi-automatic gait recognition. A persons gait signature is created using a model based approach. Temporal and spatial metrics extracted from the modal, such as variation in angles of the limb or the amplitude of a persons walking pattern can all be used to create a “gait signature ” of the individual which are transformed in eigenspace using Principle Component Analysis and can be used to identify the subject in subsequent video sequences.
