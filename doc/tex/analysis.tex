\section{Analysis}
This section will analyze the potential for biometric measurements on the
\textit{Apple Watch}. The analysis will cover both the hardware and
software, i.e.\ which sensors are included in the watch and how they are 
utilized by the SDK. The sensors will also be evaluated on their usefulness 
for biometric identification. Finally the analysis should result in a
selection of sensors found appropriate for the prototype.

\subsection{Sensors}
The \textit{Apple Watch} includes a multitude of sensors \cite{watchspecs}, 
which are used mainly for activity, fitness and health tracking, but they are
also used for some security functionalities.

\subsubsection{Heart rate sensor}

\subsubsection{Accelerometer}

\subsubsection{Gyroscope}

\subsubsection{Microphone}


\subsubsection{NFC}
The potential of an NFC chip in the watch seems promising for access control, as
it could allow for interaction with third-party devices, i.e.\ NFC readers. This
could be utilized for doors which rely on NFC key cards, where the watch could
function as a secure device containing the NFC key cards. 
Unfortunately This is simply not possible, as Apple has restricted developer 
access to the NFC chip, only allowing it to be used with their own \textit{Apple
    Pay} service. 

\subsection{Limitations}
The SDK does not allow for full control of all aspects of the watch.
